# Calculator

An application built for my Application And Data Security course. That app performs a number of actions based on the properties of residue class groups.

# What I Learned

* Create and use Windows Forms
* Developped a user interface with .NET
* Implemented functionality  to the UI: Perform calculations of data received from the user in functions
